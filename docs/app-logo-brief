Creative Brief: Sogo **App** Logo

1. Project Context

Product name (working): Sogo
Product type: desktop app (custom VS Code fork) for knowledge work + operational execution

Core promise: combines Notion-style databases with the power of a real development workspace

Key differentiator: databases live directly in the main editor workflow, not bolted on as a side tool

Data model: local-first JSON databases with optional Supabase sync

User reality: founder/operators, small teams, AI-native workflows, lots of context switching across docs/tasks/projects

2. Brand Objective

Create a brand identity that feels like: command center intelligence, calm control, high signal, zero clutter.

Avoid generic “productivity SaaS” visuals.

Signal: serious tool for people running real biz operations who need to develop an A.I. COO style integration but don't know how to get started, not a lightweight note app.

3. Positioning Statement

“Sogo is the operational HQ for people who run real work: docs, databases, and execution in one native workspace.”

4. Messaging Pillars

One system: docs + databases + execution in one place
Context-first: records, tasks, and notes stay connected
Operator-grade: fast, structured, extensible, local-first

AI-ready: built for agent-assisted workflows inside the workspace

5. Brand Personality

Calm
Precise
Capable
Minimal, but not sterile
Sophisticated without enterprise bloat

6. Logo Brief

Create a logo system with:

App icon (small sizes): 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 px

Full wordmark + icon lockup

Monochrome and accent versions

Works on dark and light themes

Feels native in a code/editor environment (macOS dock, title bar, sidebar icon scale)

Avoid:

Overly literal database cylinders

Generic “notion clone” cues

Heavy gradients/gloss/3D

Cute mascot style

Trendy-but-short-lived AI spark/star visuals

7. Visual System Direction

Color direction:

Base: neutral blacks, charcoals, off-whites, slate grays, dark blues/midnights

Accent: calm, intelligent blue (not neon)

Typography direction:

Sans for brand/UI: modern, crisp, legible

Optional mono companion for technical flavor

Avoid playful rounded fonts and novelty display faces

Suggested vibe references:

High-end developer tools

Mission-control dashboards

Japanese minimalism + modern software polish

8. Target Audience

Founder/operators running multiple workstreams
AI-native builders using Claude/Codex in daily workflows
Users dissatisfied with tool fragmentation (Notion + docs + tasks + code split)


9. Success Criteria

Icon is instantly recognizable at tiny size
Brand feels premium and calm in both dark and light modes
Design feels native to pro workflow tooling, not generic SaaS templates

15. Practical Constraints

Must look good inside a developer-style environment
Must scale from solo founder use to broader user adoption
Should not totally lock brand to “GenZen” naming; Sogo should stand alone for other users
